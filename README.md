# Experiment---3

### Aim 
To study and implement Operators in C++  <br> 

### Software 
Visual Studio Code <br> 

### Theory 
Opeartors in C++ are the symbols that are used two perform some mathematocalor logical operations on the variables. <br> 
          They are classified into 6 types: 1. Arithematic Operators (+, -, *, /, ++, --)<br>
                                            2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)<br> 
                                            3. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)<br>
                                            4. Relational Operators (==, >, >=, <=, <, !=) <br>
                                            5. Ternary or Conditional Operators <br>
                                            6. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~)<br>

cout<<"New decrement value of c is: "<<-- c<<"\n";      
cout<<"If the numbers are equal."<<(x=a==b)<<"\n";     
cout<<"a is greater than b."<<(y=a>b)<<"\n";           
cout<<"a is smaller than b."<<(z=a<b)<<"\n";           
cout<<"Logical AND operator: "<<(a&&b)<<"\n";           
cout<<"Logical OR operator: "<<(a||b)<<"\n";
