# Experiment---3

Aim -> To study and implement Operators in C++  <br> 

Theory -> Opeartors in C++ are the symbols that are used two perform some mathematocalor logical operations on the variables. <br> 
          They are classified into 6 types: 1. Arithematic Operators (+, -, *, /, ++, --)<br>
                                            2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)<br> 
                                            3. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)<br>
                                            4. Relational Operators (==, >, >=, <=, <, !=) <br>
                                            5. Ternary or Conditional Operators <br>
                                            6. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, <<, >>, ~)<br>
